Notes

- There are four general rules:
  - the leftmost  precedence is maximal (let, var) or not (+)
  - the rightmost precedence is maximal (")", var) or not (in)

- If the rightmost precedence is maximal then the
  rightmost branch is Empty (like in var).

- Removing mixfix operators halts with an error if
  operator parts are missing or mismatched
  (for example "if else").
