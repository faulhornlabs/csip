Overview of spacing
-------------------

Space is a bottom-up algorithm constructing
a document from an unspaced parse tree:

  space : Tree -> Doc

Doc is a pair of a spaced tree and a shape:

  Doc = Tree x Shape

The spaced tree is not inspected during spacing;
Shape contains all information needed for
embedding it in a larger spaced tree.

Note that the maximum width can be adjusted
by parameterizing space.
