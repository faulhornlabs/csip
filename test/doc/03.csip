Programming languages are viewed, edited and stored as strings.

A good syntactic frontend is essential for compiler development.

It is not easy to have one...


                      layout rules
                    desugaring rules
                   name disambiguation
                  pretty printed output
                  extensible description
                 highlighted source code
                parser-printer consistency
               ............................


Let me reshape syntactic frontend design!
