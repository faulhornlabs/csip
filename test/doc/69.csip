PPrint if for pretty printing any value:

  class PPrint a
   where
    pprint :: a -> Raw

Raw is the highest level data type in the syntactic pipeline.
It is surprisingly simple to use it.

For example, the instance for tuples is:

  instance (PPrint a, PPrint b) => PPrint (a, b)
   where
    pprint (a, b) = ["(",",",")"] :@ pprint a :@ pprint b

["(",",",")"] is converted to a mixfix operator on the fly
and it encloses the pretty printed result of (a) and (b).
