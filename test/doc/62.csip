Real-life parsers carries source location information
until the error messages in a painful way.

Csip carries location information invisibly.
Essentially, the Char type is replaced by

  data CtxChar = MkChar Int (FilePath, Vector Char)

Key operations:

  char :: CtxChar -> Char
  char (MkChar i (f, v)) = v !! i

  instance Eq CtxChar where (==) = (==) `on` char

  instance IsString [CtxChar] where ...

  readFile :: FilePath -> IO [CtxChar]
  readFile f = do
    v <- Vector.readFile f
    pure [MkChar i (f, v) | i <- [0..length v]]

(The actual implementation defines CtxString
which is more efficient.)
