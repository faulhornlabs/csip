Gluing of spaced trees
----------------------

(a <+> b) is either:

  A)        a <> b
  B)    a <> " "  <> b
  C)    a <> "\n" <> b

A) is the default
B) is used if the last char of (a) and the
   first char of (b) should be separated
C) is used if the shape of the result of A) or B)
   is overweight.

A shape is overweight if
 - the length (of the first or the last line)
   is greater than the maximum width
 - the nesting complexity (of the first or the
   last line) is greater than a limit
