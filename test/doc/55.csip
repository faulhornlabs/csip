Rules for removing comments:

          newline
          /     \
       //        c   ~>   a <> spaceOf b <> newline' <> c
     /    \
    a      b

        /*   */
      /    |    \     ~>   a <> spaceOf b <> c
     a     b     c

Notes

- the precedence of "//", newline, "/*" and "*/" tokens
  should be adjusted to get the desired effect
- newline is converted to newline' which has a difference
  precedence and which is used in layout phase later
- spaceOf preserves indentation tokens and erases everything else
