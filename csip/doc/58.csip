Surprise 2
----------

Comments should respect indentation so this ill-looking
program is rejected, for example:

      a = b  where
      /*
      c = d  where
      */ e = f   

The comment lowers the indentation, so
the code will be transformed to

      a = b  where
      ;

         e = f   

which has a buggy extra semicolon.
