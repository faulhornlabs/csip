Layout rules (= replacing semicolons with indentation)
are supported by adding two new phases:


  indent . lex . tree . space . layout . op . sugar . scope
     |                             |
     |                             |
     v                             v
  replace indentation        replace begin/end/newline
  with begin/end             tokens with {/;/} tokens
  characters                 or erase them
