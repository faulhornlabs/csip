- Decimal natural number literals is easy to add

- Support for string literals can be added
   A) in the lexer (traditional)
   B) as a separate phase before removing spaces

  Csip has B) which fits better in its design.

  Moreover, Csip's strings are locally parsable.
  The tradeoff is that escape sequences are not
  supported (but there is a workaround).
